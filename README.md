**Kernel-Eye** is a stealthy, kernel-level Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agent designed to monitor system calls directly from the source. By leveraging **eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)**, it hooks into the Linux kernel to detect malicious activities that user-space antivirus tools might miss.

It functions as both an **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)** and an **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**, capable of automatically blocking threats in real-time.

## 🚀 Features

* **🚫 Active Blocking (IPS):** Automatically terminates (SIGKILL) malicious processes like reverse shells or unauthorized file modifications instantly.
* **🌐 Network Observability:** Hooks into `sys_enter_connect` to detect and report suspicious outbound connections (C2 traffic) to non-standard ports.
* **🕵️‍♂️ Process Monitoring:** Hooks into `sys_enter_execve` to detect suspicious commands, privilege escalation (Root), and shell spawning.
* **📁 File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Hooks into `sys_enter_openat` to detect unauthorized modifications to critical system files (`/etc/`, `/bin/`, `.bashrc`).
* **⚡ High Performance:** Uses in-kernel filtering (C) to drop benign noise (like `zsh`, `git`, `node`) before it reaches user space, ensuring minimal CPU overhead.
* **🔔 Real-Time Alerting:** Integrated with Discord Webhooks for instant security notifications.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
* Linux Kernel 4.15+ (Supports eBPF)
* BCC (BPF Compiler Collection) tools installed.
* Python 3.6+
* Root privileges.

# For Fedora/RHEL
```bash
sudo dnf install bcc-tools python3-bcc python3-requests
```
# For Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt-get install bpfcc-tools python3-bpfcc python3-requests
```
2. Automatic Install (Recommended)

This will set up the systemd service and configure the environment.
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/ufukulaserdem/Kernel-Eye.git](https://github.com/ufukulaserdem/Kernel-Eye.git)
cd Kernel-Eye
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
3. Configuration

After installation, you MUST add your Discord Webhook URL to the service file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/kernel-eye.service
# Edit the line: Environment="DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=YOUR_URL_HERE"
```
Then start the agent:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start kernel-eye
sudo systemctl enable kernel-eye
```

🛡️ Detection Logic (Examples)
Alert Type	Trigger Condition	Severity	Action
C2_CONNECT	Connection to known hacker ports (4444, 1337)	🔴 Critical	KILL
PERSISTENCE	Modification of .bashrc or startup files	🔴 Critical	KILL
CRITICAL	Access to /etc/shadow or /etc/passwd	🔴 High	KILL
ROOT	Any process executed with UID 0 (via sudo/su)	🟡 Medium	Log
SHELL	Spawning bash or sh (Potential Reverse Shell)	🟠 High	Log
NETWORK	Usage of curl, wget, nc (Data Exfiltration)	🔵 Low	Log

🗺️ Roadmap
✅ Completed

    [x] Process Execution Monitoring (sys_execve)

    [x] File Integrity Monitoring (sys_openat)

    [x] Network Socket Monitoring (sys_connect)

    [x] Active Blocking (IPS Mode) - Kill switch implementation

    [x] Systemd Service & Automated Installer

    [x] Discord Alerting & Rate Limiting

🚧 Phase 2: Advanced Warfare (In Progress)

    [ ] Content Analysis (YARA): Deep packet/file inspection to detect malware signatures within files (not just filenames).

    [ ] Forensic Database: Integration of a local SQLite database to store logs for historical analysis and auditing.

    [ ] Heuristic Analysis: Parent-Child process tree analysis (e.g., detecting if Word spawns PowerShell).

    [ ] Self-Protection: Preventing the agent itself from being killed by unauthorized users.
